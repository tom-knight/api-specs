            For example, if the order was placed by a combination of store credit and bank deposit the refund methods would be:
            ```json
            {

                    "provider_description": "Custom",
                    "amount": 119.35,
                    "offline": true,
                    "offline_provider": true,
                    "offline_reason": "This is an offline payment provider."
                  }
                ],
                [
                  {
                    "provider_id": "bankdeposit",
                    "provider_description": "Bank Deposit",
                    "amount": 80.35,
                    "offline": true,
                    "offline_provider": true,
                    "offline_reason": "This is an offline payment provider."
                  },
                  {
                    "provider_id": "storecredit",
                    "provider_description": "Store Credit",
                    "amount": 39,
                    "offline": false,
                    "offline_provider": false,
                    "offline_reason": ""
                  }
                ]
              ]
            }
            ```

            In this case there are three refund methods available to the merchant:
            1. Refund up to the entire order amount to store credit.
            2. Mark an amount up to the full order amount as refunded externally, through a provider or means not represented directly in BC ("custom").
            3. Refund the amount paid by store credit to store credit, and the amount paid by bank deposit via a manual refund, which will be recorded as being refunded against the bank deposit.
